# MFG598: Engineering Computing with Python 
# Final Project

You only need to execute the main.py file. Make sure the tic_tac_toe.py and connect_four.py are in the same directory as the main.py file.
Also, there has to be a folder inside the directory called 'data' to store the csv files

## Description

This project lets you play two popular board games, Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four, against an AI opponent. The project is designed to provide an enjoyable gaming experience and practice your skills against an intelligent adversary.

# Features

- Play Tic Tac Toe and Connect Four against an AI opponent.
- AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning for Connect Four, and a simple strategy for Tic Tac Toe to provide a challenging gaming experience.
- Track and store game statistics for both games, including wins, losses, and draws.
- Visual interface for Connect Four using the Pygame library.
- Terminal-based interface for Tic Tac Toe.
